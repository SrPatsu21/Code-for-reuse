The & (bitwise AND) in C takes two numbers as operands and does AND on every bit of two numbers. The result of AND is 1 only if both bits are 1.  
The | (bitwise OR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does OR on every bit of two numbers. The result of OR is 1 if any of the two bits is 1. 
The ^ (bitwise XOR) in C takes two numbers as operands and does XOR on every bit of two numbers. The result of XOR is 1 if the two bits are different. 
The << (left shift) in C takes two numbers, the left shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
The >> (right shift) in C takes two numbers, right shifts the bits of the first operand, and the second operand decides the number of places to shift. 
The ~ (bitwise NOT) in C takes one number and inverts all bits of it.
