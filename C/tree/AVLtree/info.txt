LeftSide - RightSide <= 1 //in module

case RR -> rotade clockwise
case LL -> rotate anticlockwise
case RL -> rotade clockwise and after rotade anticlockwise
case LR -> rotade anticlockwise and after rotade clockwise

//will retarn 0 for no
//1 LL 2 RR 3 Rl 5LR
*function to manage AVL
*function to make RR
